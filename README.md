# Nutrition Manager
A simple nutrition manager for tracking calories and macronutrients developed via nicegui.
This app will create two tables in a database: one for foods and one for meals. The foods table will contain the name of the food, the calories, and the macronutrients. The meals table will contain the name of the meal, the date, and the foods that were eaten.
